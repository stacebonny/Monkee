The Quevedo K. look to bounce back from a loss on Saturday night when they take on the Lukas T.. The Quevedo K. took the first game of the series on Thursday 10-6, but lost 8-1 on Friday and they are now 1-3 on the season. The Quevedo K. scored the first run of the game in the top of the second, but gave up two in the bottom of the inning and trailed the rest of the game. The Quevedo K. managed just three hits and Jameson Taillon gave up six runs in four and a third innings. The Quevedo K. will give the ball to Shota Imanaga on Saturday as they look to clinch at least a series split with the Lukas T..

Imanaga is in his second season with the Quevedo K. and he was great in 2025 as he went 15-3 with a 2.91 ERA.
