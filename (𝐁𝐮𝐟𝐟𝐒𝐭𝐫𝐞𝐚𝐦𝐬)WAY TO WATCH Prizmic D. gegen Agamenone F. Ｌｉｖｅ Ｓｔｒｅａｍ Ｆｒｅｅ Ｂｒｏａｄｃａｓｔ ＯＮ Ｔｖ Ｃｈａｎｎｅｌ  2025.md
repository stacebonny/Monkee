The Prizmic D. look to bounce back from a loss on Saturday night when they take on the Agamenone F.. The Prizmic D. took the first game of the series on Thursday 10-6, but lost 8-1 on Friday and they are now 1-3 on the season. The Prizmic D. scored the first run of the game in the top of the second, but gave up two in the bottom of the inning and trailed the rest of the game. The Prizmic D. managed just three hits and Jameson Taillon gave up six runs in four and a third innings. The Prizmic D. will give the ball to Shota Imanaga on Saturday as they look to clinch at least a series split with the Agamenone F..
