The Flint Firebirds look to bounce back from a loss on Saturday night when they take on the Kitchener Rangers. The Flint Firebirds took the first game of the series on Thursday 10-6, but lost 8-1 on Friday and they are now 1-3 on the season. The Flint Firebirds scored the first run of the game in the top of the second, but gave up two in the bottom of the inning and trailed the rest of the game. The Flint Firebirds managed just three hits and Jameson Taillon gave up six runs in four and a third innings. The Flint Firebirds will give the ball to Shota Imanaga on Saturday as they look to clinch at least a series split with the Kitchener Rangers.
